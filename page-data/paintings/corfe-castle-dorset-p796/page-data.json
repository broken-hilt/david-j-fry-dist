The castle dates back to William the Conqueror in the 11 century and underwent major structural changes in the 12th and 13th centuries. During the English Civil War it was a Royalist stronghold and withheld the first siege in 1643 but fell to the Parliamentarian forces in 1645. In March that year Corfe Castle was slighted on Parliment&#39;s orders, damaged to reduce its value as a military, administrative or social structure.</p><p></p><p>Original watercolour, image size 13.5&quot; x 10&quot;.</p><p>Mounted to fit frame size 20&quot; x 16&quot;.</p><p><strong>Price £245</strong></p><p></p><p>A signed, embossed limited edition print is available £45.</p>","id":"cklihfdjcajru0a13k7b1ffii","image":{"altText":"Corfe Castle, Dorset (Watercolour Painting)","height":329,"location":"Dorset","title":"Corfe Castle, Dorset","url_webp":"https://media.graphcms.com/output=format:webp/yX6HcWjERgKej9HXG8Bp","url_jpg":"https://media.graphcms.com/output=format:jpg/yX6HcWjERgKej9HXG8Bp","width":450},"location":"Dorset","medium":"Watercolour","metaDescription":"Watercolour Painting of Corfe Castle, Dorset.
