The village plays the fictional Portwenn in the much loved Doc Martin T.V. series. Also, based on true events from 2009, it tells the story of a bunch of men, most of them fishermen who formed a group singing sea shanties. After a had days work they would retire to their local pub, The Golden Lion for a few pints and sing. They were to become famous as the Fisherman&#39;s Friends and a film, although slighty fictioalized would tell of their rise to stardom.

In 1284 Eleanor gave birth to a son, Edward the second at Caernarfon Castle which was being rebuilt in stone that would eventually become the magnifisant castle that stands today. At the time the Welsh weren&#39;t happy about it as all the money from the Crown&#39;s Welsh lands was now his. A bitter pill to swollow for the newly conquered nation. For the last 700 years the title Prince of Wales has traditionally been taken by the eldest son of the reigning monach. It wasn&#39;t untill 1911 that the next Prince of Wales was invested at Caernarfon Castle.
